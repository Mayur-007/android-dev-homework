# Tasks
- Refactor code using Android/Object oriented programming best practices. Make it easier to read, maintain and test.
- Add unit tests
- Add possibility to filter characters by date
- Show character image and some additional information about character
- Add network request state handling (loading, error etc.)
- On a character details screen show image, some details about character and location. Show location details: name, type, dimensions.

# Bonus tasks
- Add UI tests
- Add Deep Link to go directly to character page e.g., urban-android-homework:/character?id=100
- Handle configuration change e.g. screen rotation
- On the character details screen, add a button to the new screen showing the list of residents. It will be sufficient to show only name of each resident.

# What gets evaluated
- Code quality (both production and test)
- How the navigation is being handled
- Whether the code is "production ready" (i.e. tests pass, application is working as expected)

N.B. Should you run short on time to implement all tasks, choose to
implement a subset but do it in the **highest possible** quality.
